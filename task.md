Task 1:

Enhance the storage/data model by incorporating a 'Company' object. This object should minimally store the company's name as a string.
Pre-populate the database with 3-4 companies, provided as JSON data.
Implement functionality to create new companies via a form accessible from the frontend.
Add a 'Create Company' link to the navigation bar for easy access to the company creation page.
When editing an employee's details, provide an option to associate them with an existing company from a dropdown list.
Ensure that this additional information (company association) is persistently saved in the database upon form submission.
